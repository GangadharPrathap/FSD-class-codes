        Ways to define the Colors in CSS<ul>
            <li class="color1">nmed colors</li>
            there are 147 named colors in the CSS library
            <li class="color2">RGB/RGBA (red,green,blue)</li>
            the rgb is used in order to customise the color we need to apply to our website. The representation will be in the format rgb(0,0,0). the range of each value will be 0-255. in the above other representation we have mentioned 'a' which states the transparency of the color it is called as Alpha.
            <li class="color3">HEX/HEX</li>
            HEX stands for the hexadecimal which means it has 16 values. The representation of this hex will be #000000 where each digit refer to 16 bit values<br>
            we can also use the shortend property which has only three values than the general code value like in above #000   
            <li class="color4">HSL/HSLA</li>
            In HSL the h stands for hue<br>
            s stands for saturation<br>
            l stands for light/lightness <br>
        </ul><br>

        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
        Where can I get some?
        There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.5
